# FSharp.Parser

A simple parser that is using a similar syntax with the big brother FParsec.

### Reason to be

I had issues with using FParsec(installing) on a computer with Windows in Deutch, so instead of spending time on fixing that particular issue, I invested 3h to write this.

### Roadmap

Plan in the future to add proper documentation.
To add support for "replace" in text.
